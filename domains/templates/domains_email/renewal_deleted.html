        Hello {{ name }},
    </p>
    <p>
        We tried to renew following domains as they are expiring soon. Unfortunately we failed to charge your account
        for them. This was our last attempt and unfortunately your domains have now been deleted. They'll be available
        to buy again in about 30 days (depending on registry policy).
    </p>
    <ul>
        {% for domain in domains %}
            <li>{{ domain.domain.name }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
