We tried to renew following domains as they are expiring soon. Unfortunately we failed to charge your account for them.
We'll retry a few more times in the coming days, so be sure to top up your account for these domains.
If we can't charge your account by one day before the expiry date, then our shark minions will shed a tear as they
delete your domains.

{% for domain in domains %}
- {{ domain.domain.name }} (expiring: {{ domain.expiry_date }}); reason for failure: {{ domain.error }}
{% endfor %}
