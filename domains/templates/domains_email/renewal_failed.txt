We tried to renew {{ domain }} as it is expiring soon.
Unfortunately the payment couldn't go through.
Please manually renew your domain from the domain control panel.

The reason for this failure was: {{ error }}

If the domain isn't renewed by 3 days before the expiry date, then our shark minions will shed a tear as they delete your domain.
