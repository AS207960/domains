                    We tried to renew following domains as they are expiring soon. Unfortunately we failed to charge
                    your account
                    for them. We'll retry a few more times in the coming days, so be sure to top up your account!
                    If we can't charge your account by one day before the expiry date, then our shark minions will shed
                    a tear as
                    they delete your domains.
